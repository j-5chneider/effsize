## Background & Focus | What we know about visualizing data (for lay people)

__accurately__ estimating statistical information: __plot type__ plays a role

* box plots: `r fa(name = "thumbs-up")` spread; `r fa(name = "thumbs-down")` distribution
* bar/line plot: `r fa(name = "thumbs-up")` mean
* modified stock chart: `r fa(name = "thumbs-up")` maxima, minima; `r fa(name = "thumbs-down")` spread [@albersetal.2014; @pierceetal.2013]

<div class="notes">
* there is a lot of basic research on visualizing statistical information

__supporting the process__: __enrichment options__

* benchmarks (anchoring) [@cohen.1988; @jacowitzetal.1995]
* cues (signaling) [@schneideretal.2018]

<div class="notes">
* Enrichment options for these visualizations may further support the complex processes of sense-making
* A common approach is to provide __standardized benchmarks__ against which also researchers typically anchor their interpretations
* research on multimedia learning suggests that the use of __cues__ (e.g. arrows, labels) can direct observers' attention.
* This so-called signaling effect can increase understanding and reduce cognitive load

Drawing on current research from __ES communication__ and __visualization__, we address:

* ... are participants accurately estimating the size of the effect?
* ... how quickly are they able to do it?

* now if we want to find out what are __promising plot types__ to communicate ES<br />`r fa(name = "arrow-right")`we face the challenge that there is a universe of potential plot types to investigate
* so in a __pilot study__ we consulted experts in Data Visualization and Science Communication to help us collect and rank
* "plot types that they gauge suitable for depicting effect sizes to teachers"
* synthesizing these lists, resulted in 16 suitable plot types

* there is quite some basic research on visualizing information

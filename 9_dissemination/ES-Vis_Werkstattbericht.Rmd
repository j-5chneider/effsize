concerning practical implications we look at

## Background & Focus | What we know about visualizing data (for lay people)

__accurately__ estimating statistical information: __plot type__ plays a role

* box plots: `r fa(name = "thumbs-up")` spread; `r fa(name = "thumbs-down")` distribution
* bar/line plot: `r fa(name = "thumbs-up")` mean
* modified stock chart: `r fa(name = "thumbs-up")` maxima, minima; `r fa(name = "thumbs-down")` spread [@albersetal.2014; @piercechick.2013]

<div class="notes">
* there is a lot of basic research on visualizing statistical information
* however, when plotting ES a lot of these phenomena we know about on a __small scale__ come together and interact
* there is __first evidence__ that the __type of__ visualization we choose 
* plays a role as to how __accurately__ lay people estimate statistical information

__supporting the process__: __enrichment options__

* benchmarks (anchoring) [@cohen.1988; @jacowitzkahneman.1995]
* cues (signaling) [@schneideretal.2018]

<div class="notes">
* Enrichment options for these visualizations may further support the complex processes of sense-making
* A common approach is to provide __standardized benchmarks__ against which also researchers typically anchor their interpretations
* research on multimedia learning suggests that the use of __cues__ (e.g. arrows, labels) can direct observers' attention.
* This so-called signaling effect can increase understanding and reduce cognitive load
</div>


## Background & Focus | What we know about visualizing data (for lay people)

* Laypeople are __unimpressed__ by plotted ES [@mcphetrespennycook.2020]<br /><br /><br />
* adding means to plots increases perception of ES [@kaleetal.2020]

<div class="notes">
* for d=.9: ~55% would say "Group A definitively has higher scores than Group B"
  + they would call it something between "small" and "medium"
* in a sense that it increases bias

* now if we want to find out what are __promising plot types__ to communicate ES<br />`r fa(name = "arrow-right")`we face the challenge that there is a universe of potential plot types to investigate
* so in a __pilot study__ we consulted experts in Data Visualization and Science Communication to help us collect and rank
* "plot types that they gauge suitable for depicting effect sizes to teachers"
* synthesizing these lists, resulted in 16 suitable plot types

# Current progress

## Current progress | and further plans

<div class="box60l">


* __Delphi-Study__ completed `r fa(name = "square-check")`<br /><br /><br />
* Self-generated __measures__ piloted `r fa(name = "square-check")`<br /><br /><br />
* __Study 1__ completed `r fa(name = "square-check")`<br /><br /><br />
* Registered Report:
  + `r fa(name = "square-check")` structured abstract
  + `r fa(name = "play")` stage 1 report
  + `r fa(name = "square")` stage 2 report<br /><br /><br />

so how far did we get?

* we completed the pilot study with the experts

## Questions | beyond general feedback

<div class="box60l">


* We are piloting the items on U3 and Overlap once again: Do you have any suggestions for precise wording?<br /><br /><br />
* Are there any plot types or enrichment options that you think would be interesting?<br /><br /><br />
* Would a decision-task be interesting? (trade-off: will take up a lot of time in the survey)

## Background & Focus | What we know about visualizing data (in general)

<div class="franconeri"></div>

<div class="notes">

* there is quite some basic research on visualizing information
* for example using position (dot plot) it is easier estimating the mean than using areas
* these results give us first ideas of what to expect
* however, when plotting ES, several of these phenomena come together: most plots use position AND length AND area

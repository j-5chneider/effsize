### Why effect sizes?

* "__Clearinghouse__" approaches<br />`r fa(name = "arrow-right")` Provide evidence base of systematic research [@knogleretal.2022]<br /><br /><br /><br />
* Effect sizes (ES) as one of the __key information__ [@burnsetal.2011]<br /><br /><br /><br />

## Theory
### Why visualizations?



* these have __little information value__ for teachers.  [@haneletal.2019; @lipseyetal.2012]<br /><br /><br />
* Translations (e.g. years of learning) transport __undesirable characteristics__ [@bairdpane.2019; @kimetal.2022]<br /><br /><br />
* alternative metrics (e.g. Cohen's $U_3$)
  - perceived as more informative compared to $d$. [@hanelmehler.2019]
  - Perceived as less informative compared to translations [@lortie-forguesetal.2021]
  - produce possible misconceptions <span class="citation">(Schmidt et al., under review)</span><br /><br /><br />
* Alternative: Visualizations [@franconerietal.2021]





::: {.notes}
* Evidence that for teachers __challenging__:
    - Cohen's d & percentile gain (WWC): wenig __informativ__
* Translations: transport undesirable characteristics<br />`r fa(name = "arrow-right")` e.g., poorly comparable across age levels.
* ...
* Advantage:
    - statistical information __very quickly__ and __accurately__ ascertainable.
    - depending on __type__ of visualization and __enrichment__<br />`r fa(name = "arrow-right")` box plots: `r fa(name = "thumbs-up")` dispersion; `r fa(name = "thumbs-down")` distribution.

* __Which visualization type__ performed best regarding this variable?
* in this __table__ I have colored the values __from the worst__ value (dark) to __the best__ value (green)<br />`r fa(name = "arrow-right")` you can quickly see: half-eye plots with distinction on the y-axis consistently perform best.
* Effects:
  - Halfeye vs. Gardner: small to moderate; large with efficiency
  - Halfeye vs. Raincloud: small (informativity, value), moderate (difficulty)<br /><br /><br /><br />

* Gardner-Altman - halfeye (.26 ≤ d ≤ 0.54) less __difficult__, more __informative__ and __valuable__  
* raincloud - halfeye (.25 ≤ d ≤ 0.43) less __difficult__
* halfeye __Y__ - raincloud (d = .25) __informativity__, value (d = .24)
* halfeye - halfeye (vernachlässigbar) __informativity__, value
* halfeye and raincloud - Gardner-Altman plots (-.79 ≤ d ≤ -.69) faster __dwell times__
* halfeye - raincloud (-.14 ≤ d ≤ .15) similarly __efficient__

* What we could also __observe__ were - as mentioned above - misconceptions.
* These __showed__ themselves both 
  - in the assessment of the __overlap__ 
  - as well as in the assessment of the __item formulated as Cohen's__ U3.
* In this graph you see 
  - the participants as lines on the y-axis
  - and in each case their __estimation__ on the x-axis, e.g., for the question _"How large is the overlap between the groups?"_
* d=.8 
  - Overlap: 69% (proportion of misconceptions: 20%)
  - U3: 21% (proportion of misconceptions: 55%)

## Discussion

* Visualization type __relevant predictor__ of successful communication of effect sizes<br /><br /><br />
* __Halfeye plot__ as promising visualization type<br /><br /><br />
* Evidence of danger from __misconceptions__<br /><br /><br />
* Not stand-alone: context clearinghouses and teacher education/training.

## Theory
### Why science communication?



* Teachers: are encouraged to consider __evidence__ from research [@slavin.2020; @brownetal.2017]<br /><br /><br /><br />
* Challenges: are __seldom__ based on research findings in daily practice  [e.g., @thommetal.2021]<br /><br /><br /><br />
* Current approaches for __teacher-oriented__ science communication.<br /> [@hedges.2018; @farley-rippleetal.2020]


::: {.notes}
* Teachers are encouraged to consider evidence in their professional practice
* teachers rarely draw on research evidence in their daily practice
* different strategies exist to increase / foster teachers’ engagement with evidence
* current approaches: toward a more teacher-friendly science communication
:::


## Theory
### State of research on visualization of statistical information (for laypeople)

* Laypersons are __unimpressed__ by graphically represented ES [@mcphetrespennycook.2020]<br /><br /><br />
* Adding mean values to plots increases perceived ES [@kaleetal.2020]

::: {.notes}
* for d=.9: ~55% would say "Group A definitively has higher scores than Group B"
  + they would call it something between "small" and "medium"
* in a sense that it increases bias
:::


## Theory
### What we know about visualizing data (in general)

<div class="franconeri"></div>

::: {.notes}

* there is quite some basic research on visualizing information
* for example using position (dot plot) it is easier estimating the mean than using areas
* these results give us first ideas of what to expect
* however, when plotting ES, several of these phenomena come together: most plots use position AND length AND area

:::


## Theory
### State of research on visualization of statistical information (for laypeople)

\

__Accuracy__ of estimation of statistical information: __visualization type__ plays a role

* box plots: `r fa(name = "thumbs-up")` Dispersion; `r fa(name = "thumbs-down")` distribution
* bar/line plot: `r fa(name = "thumbs-up")` Mean
* modified stock chart: `r fa(name = "thumbs-up")` Minima, Maxima; `r fa(name = "thumbs-down")` dispersion [@albersetal.2014; @piercechick.2013]

. . .

\
\

__Support in process__: __enrichment options__

* benchmarks (anchoring) [@cohen.1988; @jacowitzkahneman.1995]
* cues (signaling) [@schneideretal.2018]

::: {.notes}
* there is a lot of basic research on visualizing statistical information
* however, when plotting ES a lot of these phenomena we know about on a __small scale__ come together and interact
* there is __first evidence__ that the __type of__ visualization we choose 
* plays a role as to how __accurately__ lay people estimate statistical information

-

* Enrichment options for these visualizations may further support the complex processes of sense-making
* A common approach is to provide __standardized benchmarks__ against which also researchers typically anchor their interpretations
* research on multimedia learning suggests that the use of __cues__ (e.g. arrows, labels) can direct observers' attention.
* This so-called signaling effect can increase understanding and reduce cognitive load

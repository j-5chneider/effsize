Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants read an article describing a natural phenomenon (leaves growing on trees) as either structured or random. Afterward, they reported their motivation to pursue their most important long-term goals. The group that had read about a structured, orderly process would report a higher willingness to engage in goal-pursuit.",Kay et al. (2014),3,3,2,2
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants read a dilemma about distributing resources related to water conservation. In one group, other parties involved in the water conservation problem were referred to as “consumers”. In the other group, these parties were referred to as “individuals”. Afterward, participants had to report their trust towards the other parties involved in the water conservation problem. If other parties involved in the water conservation problem had been referred to as “individuals”, participants trusted these parties more than if they had been referred to as “consumers”.",Bauer et al. (2012),2,3,3,2
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants read a description about a new cell phone. In one group, the cell phone was called P17. In the other group, it was called P97. Afterward, participants predicted the proportion of cellphones that were sold. If the cell phone was called P97, participants predicted that a higher proportion of cell phones could be sold.",Critcher and Gilovich (2008),2,4,5,2
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants read a description of a person and were instructed to think about similarities and differences between that person and themselves. In one group, the person was described as respected and liked by peers. In the other group, the person was described as not respected and disliked by their social groups. Afterward, participants answered questions about their well-being. If participants had compared themselves to a person who is not respected and disliked, participants reported higher well-being than when they had compared themselves to a person who is highly respected and well liked.",Anderson et al. (2012),4,2,4,3
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants (college students) read a story about having wrongly been fined for speeding at 38 miles per hour (~ 61 kilometers per hour) in a 25 mph (~ 40 km/h) zone. They could decide to either pay the $20 fine or appear in a municipal court to contest the charge. Afterwards, they estimated what percentage of their peers (other college students) would pay the fine. The participants’ estimates were higher if they themselves had chosen to pay the fine than if they had chosen to appear in court.",Ross et al. (1977),2,2,3,3
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants studied a schematic display of the hierarchy within an organization, including a manager and his team. In one group, the vertical line connecting the manager to the team was long (i.e., 7 cm). In the other group, the vertical line was short (i.e., 2 cm). Afterwards, participants estimated how much power the manager held within the organization. If the vertical line connecting the manager to the team was long, participants estimated that the manager held more power within the organization than when the vertical line was short.",Giessner and Schubert (2007),2,3,5,3
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"East Asian participants categorized targets (e.g., flowers with different features) into one of two groups based either on which group the target “belongs to” or on which group the target is more “similar to”. The flowers could either be classified by a rule (e.g., whether or not the flower has some specific feature) or by resemblance (e.g., whether a flower looks similar to other flowers). The tendency to use the rule-based categorization was higher when the categorization instruction was “belongs to” rather than “similar to”.","Norenzayan, Smith, Kim, and Nisbett (2002)",2,2,2,2
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"In one condition, participants imagined receiving a $45 scarf bought in a store where the prices of scarves ranged from $5 to $50. In the other condition, participants imagined receiving a $55 coat bought in a store where the prices of coats ranged from $50 to $500. Participants perceived the gift giver as being more generous if they had received the less expensive gift (i.e., the $45 scarf) than if they had received the more expensive gift (i.e., the $55 coat).",Hsee (1998),3,2,4,3
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants saw pictures of (harm-doer) Sam and (victim) Roger. They read the following story: “Imagine that Sam pushes a tray of glasses off a table. They shatter and one of the shards cuts into Roger’s leg.” Then they were asked to rate how responsible Sam was for the accident. In one condition, participants were told that Sam (the harm-doer) was 25 years old and Roger (the victim) was 5 years old. In the other condition, the age of the characters was reversed. They perceived the harm-doer to be more responsible for the accident if he was a 25-year old man than if he was a 5-year old boy.",Gray and Wegner (2009),4,5,4,3
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants hand-copied a story written in the first person. In one group, participants rewrote an unethical short story about sabotaging a co-worker. In the other group, participants rewrote an ethical short story about helping a co-worker. Afterward, participants rated the desirability of cleaning products (e.g., soap, toothpaste). Participants who rewrote an unethical story rated the cleaning products higher than did participants who rewrote an ethical story.",Zhong and Liljenquist (2006),3,4,3,3
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants read vignettes that described the chairman of a company approving a new program that increases profit. However, as a side-effect, the new program either harmed or helped the environment. Participants who read about harmful side effects were more likely to believe that the chairman brought about the side effect intentionally than did participants who read about helpful side effects.",Knobe (2003),2,3,3,3
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),Participants were asked to indicate on a map of a fictional city where either a low-SES or a high-SES person might live. Participants who state that wealthier people in their hometown live in the North showed a larger tendency to indicate more northern locations for the high-SES person than for the low-SES person.,"Huang, Tse, and Cho (2014)",2,5,3,4
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants solved difficult logic problems. In one group, the logic problems were printed in a font that was hard to read (activating the analytical mindset). In the other group, the logic problems were printed in a font that was easy to read. If the logic problems were printed in a font that was hard to read, participants solved more logic problems correctly.",Alter et al. (2007),4,5,3,4
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants judged the likelihood of a negative outcome (i.e., being asked a question in class) to be higher when imagining themselves tempting fate (by not having done the reading), compared to when not tempting fate (by having done the reading).",Risen & Gilovich (2008),4,4,3,4
Aus Studie von Maximilian Maier (University College London),"Participants performed a task in which they had to unscramble sentences. In one group, participants read sentences that contained words related to hot temperatures. In the other group, people read sentences that contained words related to cold temperatures. Afterward, participants reported the degree to which they were concerned about global warming. Participants who read sentences containing words related to hot temperatures reported being more concerned about global warming.",Zaval et al. (2014),3,3,3,3

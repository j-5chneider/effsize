## Modeling
### IV & DV
* The dependent variables are binary (ICC = .3) or gaussian 
    (accuracy cliffs delta ICC = 0.01;
     accuracy u3 ICC = 0.55;
     accuracy overlap ICC = 0.68;
     perceived difficulty ICC = 0.43;
     perceived informativity ICC = 0.40;
     perceived value ICC = 0.50)
* The independet variables are dummy coded with max 3 binary indicator variables
* There are three covariates:
    * Topic - between person, 3 dummy variables
    * Objective effectsize - within person, continous
    * Plot type - within-person, 1 dummy variable

### Models
Bayesian generalized hierarchical models with logit link for binary DV.
As we have absolutely no clue what effect sizes to assume, we will simulate null effects at the stage of N = 0 and adapt the empirically found effect sizes afterwards.

## First simulation without any data
```{r}
logregmod_0 <- brms(notequal ~ effsize + 
                        topic_01 + topic_02 + topic_03 + 
                        plottype_01 +
                        (1|PID),
                    data = simdata)
```

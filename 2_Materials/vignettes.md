## Study "subtitles vs. no subtitles"

A group of researchers investigated whether students who watch video instructions with subtitles differ in their learning success from students who watch the same video without these subtitles. To answer this question, students were randomly assigned to one of two groups by flipping a coin. One group of students watched a video instruction with subtitles and the other group watched the same video without subtitles. Afterward, they were both asked to complete a knowledge test about the contents of the video.

## Study "simulation vs. lab"

A group of researchers investigated whether students who perform a chemistry experiment using a computer simulation differ in their learning success from students who perform an experiment with real laboratory materials. To answer this question, students were randomly assigned to one of two groups by flipping a coin. One group of students performed a chemistry experiment in the lab and the other group performed the same experiment in a computer simulation. Afterwards they were both asked to complete a knowledge test on the experiment.

## Study "live lesson vs. video lesson"

A group of researchers investigated whether students learn better from a live lesson or from a video. To answer this question, students were randomly assigned to one of two groups by flipping a coin. One group received a live online lesson (no questions possible) and another group received a video recording of the same lesson (video could be paused). Afterwards they were both asked to complete a knowledge test about this lesson.

## Study "tablet vs. paper"

A group of researchers investigated whether students memorize and understand texts better when reading them on digital devices than on paper. To answer this question, students were randomly assigned to one of two groups by flipping a coin. One group of students was given a text to read on paper and the other group of students read the same text on a tablet. Afterwards they were both asked to complete a knowledge test about this text.
